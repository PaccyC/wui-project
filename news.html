            <p class="paragraph">The miniaturization of electronics is leading to the development of next-generation devices to monitor health. People today are using various devices (typically smart watches) to measure their heart rate, the regularity of their heart rhythm, the quality of their sleep, their body temperature, and the levels of oxygen and sugar in their blood. And scientists are working on other devices—such as a thin strip of material that is pasted onto the skin—to constantly measure blood pressure, organ function, or certain body chemicals.</p>
